Feature: Class Report
    As a professor
    I want to see the generated performance report from my previous class
    So that I can see how many and why my students passed or failed and reflect on my teaching method.

Scenario: Successful generation of class report with student performance metrics
    Given the class "ESS 2025.2" has the following students and academic statuses:

        | Maria Costa  | 7.0     | passou por média  |
        | Pedro Alves  | 5.0     | vai para a final  |
    And I am logged in as professor "Paulo Borba"
